                        about a person
                        with a lantern.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-3">A handful of
                        shrines around a small farming village need to bit lit every night or else the spirits will
                        become restless! Use the lantern to find your way through the dark and light the shrines of
                        village loved-ones.</p>

                        (without any
                        pre-built
                        libraries) to build a top-down game.</p>

                        by ___), a custom tiling engine, collisions, and a custom lighting system are all part of what

                    <p class="lead">The player is animated using some clever CSS and a well-organized sprite-sheet. Each
                        row of the sheet is a different frame of animation, and each row is the same animation but with
                        the character facing a different direction. By hiding the overflow of the image, we hide any
                        unused aniamtion frames.</p>
                    <p class="lead">Imagine a flip-book. In a flip-book, the frames of animation are "stored"
                        vertically, and by flipping the pages you move vertically down the stack, causing an animation
                        to play. To animate our player, we "flip" through each column of our sprite sheet horizontaly -
                        like a fast comic strip. Because each row is a different animation (walking up, walking left,
                        standing right) we can seamlesly transition to a new animation by "fliping" to a new row!</p>

                    <p class="lead">I created and optimized a method for rendering hundreds of .png images in a grid
                        without slowing your web browser to a crawl. It features multiple layers for rendering the
                        ground, lighting, and even objects that the player can appear to walk behind!</p>
                    <p class="lead">The tilemap is interactable with a simple API that manages what tiles go where. This
                        is used for checking which tiles on the lighting layer need to be animated based on distance
                        from the player.</p>

                    <p class="lead">This game actually uses 2 lighting systems to generate the claustraphobic mood.
                        First, there's an inversed radial gradient of darkness that radiates out from the player to
                        create a soft ring of light. Second, each tile around the player is asigned a different
                        hand-drawn pixel shadow animation based on distance from the player and angle. Each hand-drawn
                        pixel shadow animation is unique for every type of tile (floor, shrine, tree branch, tree trunk,
                        etc.)</p>
                    <p class="lead">But wait! Checking every tile would slow the browser down right? Yep! That's why I
                        wrote a special method for handling the calculations for figuring out what tile the player is
                        standing on, and then only checks the tiles in a ring around the player for the appropriate
                        animations. Anything one ring around the shadow-checking ring is set to black, and anything one
                        ring inside is set to clear.</p>
